## 🏆 Recent Projects

### Traffix

Traffix is a personal project I've been working on to solve a problem I encountered. The project utilizes web scraping techniques with Puppeteer to gather traffic information from the largest traffic providers, such as Google Maps, Waze, and more. Using this data, it calculates drive time averages by days, weeks, months, and more.

The backend of Traffix is powered by Node.js, providing the necessary APIs and handling data processing tasks. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring efficient and scalable data management.

Additionally, I'm developing a Telegram bot for the UI, allowing users to access the traffic data conveniently and receive updates directly on their devices.

### Anybody

Anybody is a platform that I worked on, which aims to connect volunteers who are experts in various professions with people seeking advice, help, or instruction. For example, it could be a finance expert willing to donate 2 hours to meet with a young insurance company struggling with their reports.

The platform focuses on maintaining the experts' details hidden until a meeting actually happens to avoid spam and ensure privacy. It was built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
